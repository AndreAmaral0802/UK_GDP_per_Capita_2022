# UK_GDP_per_Capita_2022
UK GDP per capita prediction for 2022 

The UK economy is going through a difficult period with inflation going up led by the energy crises and the war between Ukrain and Russia, high debt level, and, of course with a going up trend of interest rate. The impact of these variables in the UK GDP per capita is the main concern of the population. Thus, I predicted GDP per capita for 2022 based on the following variables (UK growth, inflation, Unemployment rate, National debt level, Trade balance, and Interest rate) using a linear regression model.
